        The Birds Aren't Real movement has been active since 1976. Once a preventative cause, our initial goal was to stop the
        genocide of real birds. Unfortunately this was unsuccessful, and the government has since replaced every living bird
        with robotic replicas. Now our movement's prerogative is to make everyone aware of this fact.
